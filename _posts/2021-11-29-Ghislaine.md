### Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking trial expected to go before jury

> source: TG

Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-**trafficking[交易] trial[审判]** in Manhattan is finally expected to go before a **jury[陪审团]** on Monday, as opening statements follow finalization of the panel of 12 **jurors[陪审员]** and six alternates.

Maxwell, 59, has **pleaded[乞求，恳求，辩护]** not guilty on six counts related to her **alleged[宣称的，涉嫌的]** involvement in the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of teen girls, some as young as 14.

The charges include **conspiracy[密谋]** to **entice [引诱] minors [未成年人]** to travel to **engage[从事]** in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor.

The **indictment [诉讼]** cites four accusers – referred to as Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim- 2, Minor Victim-3 and Minor Victim-4 – though it is believed more will take the stand.

Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019, while awaiting trial. Maxwell’s alleged crimes took place from 1994 to 2004, prosecutors have said.

Authorities arrested the Briton, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, on 2 July 2020 at a secretive, expensive **estate[庄园]** in the small New Hampshire town of Bradford.

Audrey Strauss, acting Manhattan US **attorney[律师]** at the time, **contended[声称，主张，认为]** that Maxwell “played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend and **groom[培养]** minor victims” and that “in some cases, Maxwell participated in the abuse”.

The indictment charges that Maxwell “would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and Epstein”.

The Manhattan US attorney has also accused Maxwell of trying to cover up her involvement in Epstein’s crimes by providing untrue information “under **oath[宣誓]**” during **civil litigation[民事诉讼]**.

That **lawsuit[诉讼]** was the **defamation[污蔑]** case which Virginia Giuffre, a longtime Epstein accuser, brought against Maxwell. Giuffre has claimed Maxwell and Epstein **coerced[强迫]** her into sexual activity with Prince Andrew when she was 17.

Giuffre  **sued[控告]**  Maxwell, who called her a liar. Both Maxwell and the Duke of York maintain their innocence. Maxwell is charged with two counts related to the alleged lying. Those will be tried in a separate  **proceeding[诉讼程序，过程，事件]** .
