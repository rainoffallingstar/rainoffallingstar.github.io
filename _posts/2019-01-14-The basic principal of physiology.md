### ***The basic principal of physiology***

 According to Lecture notes 2017 physiology and pre-test

#### ***simple diffusion: Fick equation***

net flux = A *([s1]-[s2]) *D/d

A is area available for diffusion.

s1-s2 is concentration gradient of the substance.

d is distance for diffusion.

D is diffusion coefficient of the substance.

#### ***Mediate transport: lineweaver-burk equation***

net flux = Vmax*[s]/(Km+[s])

#### ***The flow of water through membranes by osmosis.Described by the osmotic flow equation.***

flow = k * L *(pai1 -pai2)

K is reflection coefficient.(varies between 1[impermeable] and 0[freely permeable])

L is hydraulic conductivity.

pai1 -pai2 is osmotic pressure difference across membrane.

pai is the pressure necessary to prevent solute migration.

#### ***The osmotic pressure: van't hoff equation.***

pai =RT(kIC)

R is ideal gas constant.

T is absolute temperature.

K is osmotic coefficient.

I is the number of the ions, dissociation of a molecule.

C is the molar concentration of solute.

KIC is the osmolarity of solution.Plasma osmolarity is estimated as 2[Na+]+[Glucose]/18+[BUN]/2.8.

when V changes.

pai inital *Vi =pai final *Vf

#### ***PH of plasma: Henderson - Hasselbalch equation***

PH = PK1 + log([hco3-]/[dissolved co2])

#### ***Equilibrium potential (E) is calculated with Nernst equation***

E ion = 61.5log(C out/C in)

E x+ =(60/z)log ([x+]out/[x+]in)

#### ***Dalton law :the total pressure of a gaseous mixture.such as atmosphere is equal to the sum of the partial pressure of the constituent gases.***

Pgas =(Ptotal)(F*Igas) = (Ptotal -Ph20)(F*Igas)=(Ptotal -47mmhg)(%gas/100)

Pao2 = Pco2- (Paco2/R)

R is the respiratory gas exchange ratio.(Vco2/Vo2) which under normal circumstances, its value depends on metabolism and is equal to 0.8.

VE minute ventilation = Vt(tidal volume)*respiratory rate.(breaths/min)

Vd ,anatomical dead space, is estimated as 1ml/lb of body weight.

Vd/Vt =Paco2-Peco2/Paco2.

Thus alveolar ventilation = (Vt-Vd)*respiratory rate.

Paco2 =Vco2/Va

#### ***poseuille law***

compliance is defined as Vchange/Pchange

airway resistance,R aw =Pchange/V=(Patm-Paw,cmh2o)/Flowrate,l/sec =8ln/pai r4.

l is length.n is viscosity.r is radius.

#### ***CO = HR\*SV(stroke volume)***

#### ***Laplace law***

wall stress(T) = P(systolic pressure) *r(radius of the ventricle)/w(thickness of the ventriclar wall)

#### ***capillary fluid balance***

depend on the balance between the hydrostatic(P) and the osmotic pressure (pai),and the permeability of capillary wall(Kf), starling law.

Filtration =Kf[(pai i+Pcap)-(Pi +pai cap)]

During an inflammatory response.Kf increases,plasma proteins decrease,pai cap decreases.

in the situation of kindney,the starling forces between the glomerular capillary and bowman capsules(BC),And the filtration is called GFR.

#### ***ideal gas situation equation***

PV =NRT
