#### Abstract/Concepts

Physicians have been viewed as soilders fighting against disaeses in the front line for many years,and most of the health-care systems are dieases-centre in the world.People may has a believe in physicians that they could cure all the disease,but this is wrong.For the last century,terminal diseases like cancers or nerodegeneration have took away many lives with unbearable sufferings.For suffering from such pain in body and soul,the request for enthansia or PAS has been devoised.In a survey in American,for many years there has been a consistent increase in the number of request for PAS. In some European nations and some states in America,the goveronments have legalized it.

In many cases,PAS has saved people from painful and hopeless lives,and there are also concerns about this issue.

#### Views & Questions from the opposed side

Once we groups looked into PAS in the first sight,another word "enthansia"came into our mind.Are these two concepts the same? Then we knew there are a few differences between them,enthensia is a much larger concept that means a physician  end a patient's life using medication or in other methods,in this case ,the physician is an executor,but PAS is a voluntary and self-determine proceduce requested by a patient with clear mind under full consideration and well-inform(according to European white paper).Physician only provides them with lethal drugs here.So we can conclude that PAS is a more mature death method when refering to enthansia.

But in christian's view or in traditional Chinese culture,people can't have their right to die,and what is worse is that few nations in the world have made it clear in law.People may think a man/woman shouldn't die for his/her responsibility to family or their god,or they think the patient should take palliative care to die naturally,but this kind of thinking is totally standing in the viewers' insterest.How about think about this in the patient's insterest,do he/her want to suffer more?Do he/her want to live hopelessly and depressly?when a patient is sentenced to die by a physician,lying in the bed requesting for death,you ask him to live for you is adding an extra burden/duty on him/her.Tt is unfair that he/her can't decide wheather to die under outside pressure.

In other opposed views,people may concern about  widespread abuse of these pratices,or killing to become accepted within society.These concerns do exist,but our group think the legal process could answer it perfectly.

#### what a truly PAS is & some cases

What is the process of PAS?In American,a patient should have two oral requests and then two independent physicians will evalue it and decide wheather it meets legal criteria and the decision is made under full-consider and well- inform, then a final written request should be handed in and then the physician should provide medications for the patient.After the death of the patient, the doctor must report the procedure to the Regional Euthanasia Review Committees
(RERCs) which assess whether or not the criteria have been met.

There are many cases about PAS or enthansia,such as a BBC documentary *how to die: Simon's choice* or other cases reported in medical jouranls. In a case,in the meeting one year after carrying out the procedure,the family shows that they were mouring but respected and understood the patient's decision.in another case,the family declared to be grateful for the way their relative was honoured in his wish and valued as a person.

Thus we think that the right to die is a basic human right for a patient without prospects to be cured.To be or not to be,it is the patient's problem,we can't answer it for him/her.In nations recongnized this,goveronments ackonwledge that PAS is a better method to serve the patients with humanism care.The request and the need of patients should be respected and considered.  In this way,renaissance takes place ,making the health-care system change from diseases-centre into a patient-centre one.Finally,the dark side has its light.The lives are respected and equal.The death is a release.And the debate among lives will go on.
