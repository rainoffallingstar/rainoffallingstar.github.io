### Jussie Smollett was ‘real victim’ of racist attack, lawyer says as trial begins

> source: TG

Jussie Smollett “is a real victim” of a “real crime,” his attorney said in opening statements at the ex-Empire actor’s trial Monday, rejecting prosecutors’ allegation that he staged a homophobic[歧视...] and racist attack in Chicago.

Defense attorney Nenye Uche said two brothers attacked Smollett in January 2019 because they didn’t like him, and that a $3,500 check the actor paid the men was for training so he could prepare for an upcoming music video, not as payment for staging a hate crime, as prosecutors allege. Uche also suggested a third attacker was involved and told jurors there is not a “shred[碎片]” of physical and forensic[用于法庭的] evidence linking Smollett to the crime prosecutors allege.

“Jussie Smollett is a real victim,” Uche said.

Special prosecutor Dan Webb said the actor recruited the brothers to help him carry out a fake attack, then reported it to Chicago police, who classified it as a hate crime and spent 3,000 staff hours on the investigation. Smollett said he was attacked by supporters of then-president Donald Trump, a report that ignited[点燃] political and ideological[意识形态] divisions[分歧] around the country.

“When he reported the fake hate crime that was a real crime,” said Webb.

Smollett is charged with felony[重罪] disorderly conduct[扰乱社会治安行为] which carries a prison sentence of up to three years, but experts have said it is likely that if Smollett is convicted he would be placed on probation[缓刑] and perhaps ordered to perform community service.

Webb told jurors Smollett was unhappy about how the studio handled the letter he received. That letter included a drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree and “Maga”, a reference to Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign slogan, Webb said.

He said Smollett then concocted[杜撰] the fake attack and had a “dress rehearsal[排练]” with the two brothers, who worked on the “Empire” set with Smollett, including telling them to shout racial and homophobic slurs[含糊不清的] and “Maga”. Smollett also told the brothers to buy ski masks, red hats and a rope, Webb told jurors.

“He told them to use a rope to make it look like a hate crime,” Webb said.

But Uche said Smollett had turned down extra security when the studio offered it. He also portrayed[描绘] the brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, as unreliable, saying their story has changed while Smollett’s has not.

Whether Smollett, who is Black and gay, will testify remains an open question. But the siblings will take the witness stand. Jurors also may see surveillance video from more than four dozen cameras that police reviewed to trace the brothers’ movements before and after the reported attack, as well as a video showing the brothers purchasing supplies hours earlier.

Buried in nearly 500 pages of Chicago police department reports is a statement from a resident who says she saw a white man with “reddish brown hair” who appeared to be waiting for someone that night. She told a detective that when the man turned away from her, she “could see hanging out from underneath his jacket what appeared to be a rope”.

Her comments could back up Smollett’s contention that his attackers draped a makeshift noose around his neck. Further, if she testified that the man was white, it would support Smollett’s statements – widely ridiculed because the brothers are Black – that he saw pale or white skin around the eyes of one of his masked attackers.

The trial is expected to take one week.
